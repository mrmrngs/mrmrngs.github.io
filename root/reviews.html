            <h3>Happy Companions</h3>
           <div class="reviews">
                <p>Nevena,<br> Lucy is the prettiest girl I have ever seen! She speaks with her eyes and loves with her heart. She feels with me when I am sad and she purrs in my ear with her love. She is unconditional and the sweetest dog ever! She is the apple of my eye and loves me like no other and I don't know what I would do without her and she would be lost without me! Thank you Nevena! ❤❤❤ <br>Barbara</p>
                <p>Hi Nevena!<br /> Just wanted to let you know what a good boy we have in "Cisco".  [...] He turned out exactly as we had hoped when we were looking for a puppy.  As Ed said (who did not ever want a dog!), "the only thing wrong with Cisco is I love him too much!" Cisco is now 14 months old and just a big darling boy. [...] Everyone in the neighborhood knows him, as he is sooo friendly and loving.  The groomers think he is beautiful and people always stop to compliment him! Thank you so-o-o much!<br>Sherri</p>
                <p>Hi Nevena!<br><br>Rex is now 8 months old and a bundle of fun! He has completely stolen the heart of each family member and has bonded beautifully with our 3 year old Havanese, Dash. In fact, when we decided to bring a second dog into our family we only considered another Havanese, having had such a wonderful experience with our first Havanese. Finding a reputable breeder was our top priority, and we feel that is exactly what we found with you. Rex is not only in top physical health, but temperamentally he is a complete joy. He just loves to be included in all family activities and is a great little traveler, but he’s equally content to lie beside you and have his tummy tickled (a favorite morning ritual). It’s so much fun to see him play with Dash and his half-brother, Desi, another one of your beautiful dogs adopted by my cousin’s family! We are so happy to have Rex in our family and thank you, again, for breeding such wonderful dogs!<br><br>The Martellos</p>

            <h3>Health &amp; Personality</h3>
           <div class="reviews">
                <p>Hi Nevena!<br>Oso has been a true joy and so much fun! VERY loving, owner oriented and full of it![...] Yesterday I took Oso to see the vet. The vet said he has seen many Havanese, but never one as nice as Oso. He raved over his conformation, health, temperament. He is so solid, steady and friendly - just stood for the vet as if he were being judged in a dog show, and then licked the vet when he was through. The vet said his teeth are remarkable, and that Oso has such perfect conformation, coat, etc that he could be a Champion! Isn't that wonderful? He will be OUR Champion with no showing except perhaps in Obedience. [...] He is a GEM!!!<br><br>With appreciation,<br>Lowrey</p>
                <p>Hi Nevena,<br><br>I hope this finds you well. It has been 2 months since we brought home Romeo &amp; Cupid (now known as Bongo &amp; Mojo). What little bundles of joy! I am so glad we got two! They couldn't be more fun and absolutely adore each other. Play, play, play all day, with a few naps and walks in between. I am constantly amazed at how smart they are. As you know, we had two large Huskies we had to put down last year, so we didn't know what to expect from a small dog, but what we have found is these are big dogs in a little body. They are so confident! They love meeting new people and are so good with kids.<br><br>Thank you, thank you, thank you for all your dedication to maintaining this breed and for allowing us to grow our furry family with these guys. Can't picture my life without them!<br><br>Best<br>Shawn &amp; James</p>

            <h3>Intelligence &amp; Obedience</h3>
            <div class="reviews">
                <p>Dear Nevena:<br>[...]  Bandit is so smart and it has been fun teaching him little tricks to amaze our family and friends; sit, shake, lay down, turn around, other way, go around, circle and up.  He learns them in a day or two max.  He loves to go everywhere with us, and I mean everywhere.  He is like a magnet to people who want to meet him.  [...] Everyone comments on his beautiful markings and how happy he is.  [...] We have passed your name along so many times all across the western U.S.  You were so right about him.  I cannot imagine a dog with a better disposition.  You knew he was really special.<br>[...]<br>Thank you again so much,<br>Ross and Michael</p>
                <p>Nevena,<br><br>Pablo has been taking obedience classes.  We're starting his second one in January.  So far, he's one of the best-trained dogs in the whole class.  He's very enthusiastic and a quick learner.  The teacher uses him as an example dog in front of the class for many things.<br>Hope you have a nice holiday!<br><br>-Matt</p>

            <h3>Our Favorite Recommendation</h3>
            <div class="reviews">
                <p>To start out, I had not had dogs for a long time, because both my husband and I work, and I did not want to leave a puppy home alone for a long time.  Then someone said “just get two to keep each other company,” so I did.  I do work part-time, and the dogs are not alone more than 4 hours at a time.<br><br>Since I had not had dogs for so long, I wanted to research to be sure I was happy with my purchase. I did not want a dog that sheds, and we have small yards here in Las Vegas, so I wanted small dogs, but I wanted them sturdy and playful. This is how I settled on Havanese, which I had never heard of before I did my research.<br><br>Nevena Havanese was the only breeder in Las Vegas, so next I researched the website and breeder.  I visited the house several times, and Nevena was always welcoming and able to answer any questions that I had.<br><br>Before we entered the house we took off our shoes, were asked to wear freshly laundered clothes, and once inside we used anti bacterial wipes if we were going to handle puppies.  The puppies are raised in her home and are not caged, but kept together in a dog playpen (fencing).<br><br>When I saw the puppies they were always in her living room, which she keeps for the purpose of showing the puppies. [...]  I saw both the parents, and even other adults that she has.  I feel that she is meticulous about protecting her dogs from any chance of infection, viruses, worms etc from outside sources.  She has all of her breeding females and males extensively health tested.<br><br>I liked that the dogs are raised in her home by Nevena. She takes care of them herself, and does not have others doing that job. I feel that she is very professional about her breeding.  She is very particular about “adopting out” her puppies, and she really cares that they go to a good home.<br><br>I asked her to watch the puppies and pick two that got along and played together well.  That’s how I got Lucy and Charlie Brown.  They have been a joy. My vet wrote “fantastic” on my first check up with them.  He was very impressed with their health, conformation, teeth etc.  They tested negative for worms, which he said is hard to do with puppies, since they are into everything. (Nevena had told me her puppies never have worms.) I bought Lucy and Charlie’s littermate sister Bella for my granddaughter a couple of weeks later. Little white girl Bella was her birthday present from me.<br><br>Sorry to be so lengthy, but I am so happy with my dogs and I feel Nevena is so conscientious about her breeding and raising of her dogs that I cannot say enough.  I actually bought another dog from her, a dark chocolate and white girl named Sissy.  All my “kids” have never had any problems, not even worms! They each have their own personalities, but all are fun loving and eager to please.  Their best day is spent just being with you. They all play together and entertain me and my husband every day.<br><br>My neighbor fell in love with my dogs, and bought a total of three puppies from Nevena. She recently told me it was the best money she ever spent! Nevena really wants puppies to get a good start.  She is always available if you have questions, and actually sits down with you when you get a puppy, goes over several printed information sheets, and sends the puppy home with a blanket its mother slept with plus toys, food and treats.<br><br>I don’t think you could find a more caring or dedicated breeder.  She really wants to find the right home for each puppy and if you tell her the personality that appeals to you most, she really knows which puppy or puppies would fit best with you.  I hope this helps.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.<br><br>Linda</p>
