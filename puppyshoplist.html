    <h2>Items you will need for your Havanese Puppy</h2>
<!--    SECTION ONE-->
    <section class="s1">
       <h3>Basic Essentials</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h6>A Bed for Puppy</h6> Buy a bed that will fit your dog when full grown. I like the donut beds because you can throw them in the washing machine and the raised rim gives your puppy a place to rest their head.</li>
            <li><h6>Food Bowl and Water Dish</h6> I prefer a stainless steel dish with a rubber rim around the bottom to prevent sliding on the floor. A ceramic bowl is my second choice. There are also bowls with attached reservoirs or fountain type bowls with water filters.</li>
            <li><h6>High Quality Kibble</h6> Puppy will go home with food. Please see “Feeding your Havanese” on the <a href="puppycaretips.html">Puppy Care Tips</a> page.</li>
            <li><h6>Collar, Leash, and Harness</h6> You will need a collar (I recommend nylon with a plastic connector) that will adjust to your puppies growth, with a comfortable, snug fit. A harness is best for long walks since dogs/puppies can slip out of a collar.</li>
            <li><h6>Identification Tag</h6> A pet identification tag with your phone number (include area code) and cell phone number is imperative. Should your pet become lost, identification will expedite its return to you.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
<!--    SECTION TWO-->
    <section class="s2">
        <h3>For the Pup</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h6>Treats</h6> Liver treats, small amounts of cheese, or meat only. Please bear in mind that some treats can pose a choking hazard and too many treats can cause liver and/or kidney problems. There has been recent news of treats from China being particularly bad for your puppies' health.</li>
            <li><h6>Rawhide Chews</h6> Bully sticks and pig, cow, and lamb ears are great for exercising puppy teeth. You should always supervise your puppy with rawhide.</li>
            <li><h6>Toys</h6> Havanese love all kinds of toys and having plenty of them discourages puppies from chewing on your belongings. My dogs love squeaky toys and long furry tug-o-war toys as well as braided fleece ropes. Make a toy basket somewhere in your house and your dog will visit it frequently. Avoid choking hazards such as: buttons and toys with beans and pellets.</li>
            <li><h6>Puppy Shampoo and Conditioner</h6> All soap should be tearless. I love Buddy’s, Lavender &amp; Mint scent. It is soap free with no chemicals and additives. Find it here  www.kvvet.com or try Petco or PetSmart.</li>
            <li><h6>Grooming Tools:</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>a pin brush (metal) I like Greyhound brushes by Ashley Craig as well as Vellus brushes</li>
                <li>original greyhound metal comb with both wide and closely set teeth</li>
                <li>a flea comb for brushing hair around the eyes</li>
                <li>spray bottle for misting the coat with water before combing or brushing it</li>
                <li>Latex bands or covered bands for keeping the coat out of puppy's eyes (Sally’s Beauty Supply). Keeping their coat out of eyes is very important.</li>
                <li>Hair dryer</li>
                <li>Nail clippers</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
<!--    SECTION THREE-->
    <section class="s3">
        <h3>For the House</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h6>Nature's Miracle Stain and Odor Remover</h6> It really works! Just follow the directions. All puppies will have accidents now and then.</li>
            <li><h6>Crate</h6> Having a crate with adjustable dividers will aid in house breaking your growing puppy. Puppies have a natural tendency to soil their sleeping areas, so, adjust the crate so your puppy has just enough room to stand up, turn around, and lie down. If you get a crate that’s too big, he’ll use one half as a bedroom and the other half as a bathroom.</li>
            <li class="heading"><h6>Optional Items:</h6></li>
            <li><h6>Pet Gate</h6> for restricting puppy from "off-limit" areas of your house. I have several Hands-Free gates installed in my house.</li>
            <li><h6>Exercise Pen</h6> for keeping puppy confined when you are away for potty training purposes. Petco and Petsmart sell them, made by Precision. It will set up easily in your house in any configuration you need.</li>
            <li><h6>Doggy Door</h6> I love the freedom of dogs having access to their potty area whenever they want. I have 3 doggy doors installed in my house. You can find doggy doors at home improvement and pet supply stores. The alternative is to hang a bell from the door where puppy exits. The puppy must be able to easily reach the bell and jingle it with a touch of its nose. To train puppy to do this, "play with the bell," making sure puppy touches it, immediately praise and open the door for puppy to go out. This will only work if you are willing to let your pup out every time they jingle the bell. This system works for many dog owners. </li>
