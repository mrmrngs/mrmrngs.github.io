            <h3>Feeding Your Havanese</h3>
            <p>A pup leaving their mom and siblings is the biggest change in a puppy’s life, so their diet should not change immediately as well. You will be provided with information regarding the brand of food your new puppy is currently eating and you should continue with the same food for a while. When and if you do make the switch, make it gradual. Introduce the new food slowly, while scaling back on the old brand. Switching instantly can cause diarrhea.</p>
 
            <p>When shopping for a new food, shop at Petco, PetSmart, or a feed store with higher quality foods.
            Suggested Brands: Flint River Ranch, Natural Balance, Taste of the Wild, Chicken Soup for Puppy Lover’s Soul, Wellness, Solid Gold, Eagle Rack, Innova, etc.
            Avoid: Foods with corn of chicken by-products, grocery store brands, and foods with too much or too little protein. 22% protein is optimal.</p>

        <h3>Poisonous Foods</h3>
        <p>We all know our pets aren’t supposed to have people food, but you may not know that foods that are healthy for us humans, may be poisonous to our pups. I’ve compiled a list of those foods here:</p>
        <ul id="foodlist">
            <li>Avocado - studies show they contain a toxin called Persin.</li>
            <li>Onions, onion powder, chives and garlic - can cause gastrointestinal irritation and red blood cell damage.</li>
            <li>Grapes and raisins - can be toxic and may cause kidney failure. </li>
            <li>Yeast dough - can rise in your pup’s stomach, causing pain and intestine rupture.</li>
            <li>Bones - they are a choking hazard, and can splinter and puncture your pet’s intestines.</li>
            <li>Undercooked meat and eggs - can contain harmful bacteria.</li>
            <li>Foods with a high salt or fat content - can cause upset stomach, diarrhea, vomiting, and pancreatitis. Salty foods can also pose a risk for the development of sodium ion toxicosis.</li>
            <li>Chocolate, coffee, alcohol - can cause vomiting, diarrhea, panting, excessive thirst and urination, hyperactivity, tremors, seizures, and potentially death in pets. The higher the 		      cocoa percentage, the more dangerous the chocolate is.</li>
            <li>Sugarless candies (products sweetened with xylitol) - can cause liver damage and even death in some more vulnerable dogs. Xylitol is in many products including gum, candy, sugar-free cookies and toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Macadamia nuts - can cause weakness, vomiting, tremors and hyperthermia in dogs. Symptoms generally last up to two days, and usually appear within 12 hours of ingestion.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What do you do if your pet ate something poisonous?</h4>
        <p>If your animal is having seizures or losing consciousness, bring him or her to your veterinarian or emergency vet center. If your pet is not showing symptoms, but ingested something potentially toxic, call the ASPCA hotline at (888) 426-4435. Have the following information available: the species, breed, age, sex, weight, and information about the product exposure. It is best to have the package of the product available for reference.</p>

    <section class="s3">
       <img src="images/housebreaking.png" alt="housebreaking">
       <div class="s3grid">
           <h3>Housebreaking</h3>
           <p>The most important thing is to have a regular schedule for taking your puppy outside to do their business. Take your pup out every two to three hours: after waking up in the morning or after a nap, after eating, and after vigorous play. When a puppy puts its nose to the ground and starts running around in circles, it’s time to take him out! Take your puppy to the same spot every time, and give the same command "Go potty,” and tons of praise when he goes.</p>
           <p>The best strategy is to set your puppy up for success by making it difficult for him to make a mistake. Do not give your puppy run of the house. Confine him to a tiled or non-porous floor until he is reliable. Allow him on the rug for limited amounts of time after he has just done his business. It is not the worst thing in the world if your puppy has an accident. We just don't want it to become a habit or pattern.</p>
