            <h3>What Are Havanese Dogs?</h3>
            <div class="mobbg">
                <p>Havanese are a true companion dog, born to follow their people everywhere. They are small but study, very loving and affectionate, and not overly vocal or "yappy." Havanese dogs have a double silk coat that comes in a wide range of colors and combinations, and is considered to be non-shedding and hypoallergenic. Because they have hair, and not fur, they are not prone to "doggy" odor.</p>
                <p>Havanese make great family pets with charming, happy dispositions â€” truly like a Golden Retriever in a smaller, non-shedding package. They are devoted and very willing to please, and love children and other pets. Havanese puppies are curious, busy and sometimes fearless, and are also great traveling companions. These little dogs are alert and quick to understand what is expected of them. They are extremely intelligent, and lack none of a terrier's hardy stamina.</p>
                <p>Havanese dogs have been known to heroically guard small children, and tales are told of them doing everything from herding ducks, to performing circus acts. They are loveable natural clowns, and only want to be with their family and make them happy!</p>

           <h3>Our Health Promise</h3>
           <div class="mobbg">
                <p>Our Havanese dogs are registered with the <a href="https://www.akc.org/" target="_blank">American Kennel Club</a>. We only breed unrelated dogs to secure breed vigor, fertility, and overall health. Our dogs are examined for all <a href="https://www.ofa.org/" target="_blank">OFA</a>-recommended health tests and <a href="https://www.ofa.org/about/chic-program" target="_blank">CHIC</a> (Canine Health Information Center)-certified. It is very important for us to bring healthy Havanese puppies into the world. The Havanese breed is a healthy, long-lived breed, with very few health issues relative to other breeds, and Nevena Havanese wants to keep it that way. </p>
                <p>Responsible breeders will screen their dogs for potential problems, and breed only those that pass all the health tests required by <a href="https://www.havanese.org/" target="_blank">Havanese Club of America</a>. We do everything possible to ensure that you will get a healthy Havanese puppy who will be your companion for many years to come.</p>
